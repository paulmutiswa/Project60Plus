<h1>Project 60+</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In my first work project, I took on the task of creating an interactive dashboard using Power BI. The goal was to develop a comprehensive and visually appealing tool that would enable users to interact with data in a meaningful way. This data had to do with creating a dashboard with a list of students who needed a better job, companies looking for talent, countries these students come from, and their majors. To achieve this, I started by gathering the necessary data from various sources and carefully assessing its quality and relevance. Next, I designed an intuitive user interface that allowed for seamless navigation and exploration of the data. This involved incorporating a combination of charts, graphs, and tables that effectively summarized key trends and insights. I utilized various interactive features such as slicers, filters, and drill-through actions to enhance user engagement and enable deep dive analysis. Throughout the project, I paid close attention to aesthetics ensuring a professional look-and-feel through consistent branding elements and well-chosen color schemes.
